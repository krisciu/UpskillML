# UpskillML

## Overview

`UpskillML` aims to provide a comprehensive, hands-on guide for software developers looking to transition into the world of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Built by devs for devs, our objective is to take you from your comfort zone in software development to a confident practitioner in AI/ML.

**Disclaimer**: This project is a 'living document' and will be updated regularly as new techniques and best practices emerge in the AI/ML landscape.
